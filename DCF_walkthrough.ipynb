    "For this lesson we’ll create a DCF model using financial data for Apple, maker of iPhones and iPads, and currently the largest company in the stock market (by market cap). To follow along manually, go to [stockrow](https://stockrow.com/) , type “AAPL” into the search bar, and navigate to the “Financials” section — specifically the “trailing” section which is short for Trailing 12 Months.\n",
